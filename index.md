Hello, my name is Cyrille. I am a bioengineering student at Yildiz Technical University in Istanbul, Turkey. As an aspiring bioengineer, I aim to utilize machine learning, deep learning and bioinformatics to make a positive impact in global healthcare. I'm also interested in the applications of computational and systems biology approaches in understanding the pathophysiology of cancer.  

I am a self-taught datascientist, bioinformatician and systems biologist, and I intend to use my knowledge in these fields and apply them in medical image analysis for diagnostic purposes, and in cancer drug design for targeted therapies. I enjoy gathering, organizing and analyzing information, working in groups and contributing to project strategies.       

## Vision  
* To be part of new breakthroughs in medical diagnosis, prognosis and companion diagnosis, as well as advancements in biomedical research. 
* To be part of great Innovation in biomedical technologies.  
* To contribute to the making of a healthier world.    
   
## Hobbies  
During my free time, I read books, watch movies, listen to music, sing, hangout with friends or do a combination of both. However, my favourite hobby is singing, as singing helps me release my stress and to be more productive.
