## Most Recent Acivities 

- Recently, I participated in the Health Analytics Career Panel with [BlackTIDES](https://twitter.com/BlackTIDES1) on Twitter Spaces. We had almost 200 attendees at the event.
- I launched the Public Health & Data Science Newsletter on [Substack](https://publichealthdatascience.substack.com/). I created this to have a central source of information on how data science methods are applied to public health. I post the latest research, news, jobs, and events in this field.
