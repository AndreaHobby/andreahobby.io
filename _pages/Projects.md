Below are some of my most recent projects.    

## Project 01 | Teknofest AI in Healthcare Competition  
MARCH 2021- SEPTEMBER 2021  

![image tooltip here](/images/project01.jpg)

This project was part of the teknofest artificial intelligence (AI) for healthcare 2021 competition. And I worked under the two man team, AI KNIGHTS, with [Beltus Nkwawir](https://www.linkedin.com/in/beltus/), a computer science master's student at Istanbul Technical University, as the team leader. 

In this project, the task was to create a deep learning model that can identify areas of the brain that show signs of stroke; ischemic or hemorrhagic strokes, in brain CT  images. We built both a classification model to tell if an image has stroke or not, and, a segmentation model to mark pixels in the brain CT scan where the stroke is found. 

We used transfer learning and ensemble max voting methods to perform both the classification and segmentation tasks, and, our team was ranked number 16 out of 53 teams that got to the final stage of the competition and 229 teams that registered.
